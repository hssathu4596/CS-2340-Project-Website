        <h2>Design and Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            GreenPlate's architecture is designed around the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern, leveraging Android Studio and Java to create a robust and maintainable application. MVVM separates the user interface logic from the business logic, promoting a clean and organized codebase that is easy to understand, test, and maintain.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Components -->
        <h3>Components</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents the data and business logic of the application.</li>
                    <li>Encapsulates data sources, such as our Firebase database.</li>
                    <li>Provides methods for retrieving, updating, and deleting data.</li>
                    <li>Acts as classes for ingredients, meals, and other entities.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>View:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents the user interface components of the application.</li>
                    <li>Observes changes in the ViewModel and updates the UI accordingly.</li>
                    <li>Delegates user interactions to the ViewModel for processing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>ViewModel:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.</li>
                    <li>Contains the presentation logic and state of the UI.</li>
                    <li>Retrieves data from the Model, processes it, and exposes it to the View via observable properties.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <!-- Design Patterns -->
        <h3>Design Patterns</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Observer/Observable Pattern:</strong>
                <p>We utilize the Observer design pattern through the utilization of MutableLiveData objects that provide the connections between classes. For example, the cookbook monitors the pantry and updates every time there are ingredients added or removed from the pantry. The cookbook calculates whether there are sufficient ingredients and indicates to the user whether they would be able to cook the recipe. In this case, the pantry serves as the observable part of the pattern and the cookbook servers as the observer. 
</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Factory Pattern:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encapsulates the creation of ViewModel instances.</li>
                    <li>Provides a centralized location for constructing ViewModels with their dependencies.</li>
                    <li>Promotes code reuse and maintainability by abstracting ViewModel creation logic.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Strategy Pattern:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encapsulates the creation of ViewModel instances.</li>
                    <li>Provides a centralized location for constructing ViewModels with their dependencies.</li>
                    <li>Promotes code reuse and maintainability by abstracting ViewModel creation logic.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            By adopting the MVVM architecture pattern and implementing various design patterns within Android Studio using Java, GreenPlate achieves a well-structured, maintainable, and scalable codebase. The separation of concerns between the Model, View, and ViewModel enables developers to work efficiently and collaboratively, while also ensuring a smooth user experience for GreenPlate's users. With a focus on clean architecture and best practices, GreenPlate is poised to deliver a sustainable food management solution that makes a positive impact on both users and the environment.

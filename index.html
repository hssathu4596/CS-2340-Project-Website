        <h2>Design and Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            GreenPlate's architecture is designed around the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern, leveraging Android Studio and Java to create a robust and maintainable application. MVVM separates the user interface logic from the business logic, promoting a clean and organized codebase that is easy to understand, test, and maintain.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Components -->
        <h3>Components</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents the data and business logic of the application.</li>
                    <li>Encapsulates data sources, such as our Firebase database.</li>
                    <li>Provides methods for retrieving, updating, and deleting data.</li>
                    <li>Acts as classes for ingredients, meals, and other entities.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>View:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents the user interface components of the application.</li>
                    <li>Observes changes in the ViewModel and updates the UI accordingly.</li>
                    <li>Delegates user interactions to the ViewModel for processing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>ViewModel:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.</li>
                    <li>Contains the presentation logic and state of the UI.</li>
                    <li>Retrieves data from the Model, processes it, and exposes it to the View via observable properties.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <!-- Design Patterns -->
        <h3>Design Patterns</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Observer/Observable Pattern:</strong>
                <p>We utilize the Observer design pattern through the utilization of MutableLiveData objects that provide the connections between classes. For example, the cookbook monitors the pantry and updates every time there are ingredients added or removed from the pantry. The cookbook calculates whether there are sufficient ingredients and indicates to the user whether they would be able to cook the recipe. In this case, the pantry serves as the observable part of the pattern and the cookbook servers as the observer. 
</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong> Singleton Pattern:</strong>
                <img src="./Singleton.png">
                <p>We made the User class a singleton because it makes sense to have only 1 user at a time logged into the app. Each time a user logs into the app, a new User object is created for the user that is logged into the app. There should not be multiple users logged into the app on the same device at a time, so making the User class a singleton prevents this from happening by only allowing 1 user object to be created.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Strategy Pattern:</strong>
                <img src="./Strategy.png">
                <p>This code snapshot demonstrates the use of the Strategy design pattern because the RecipeFragment class can dynamically choose from the filtering strategies at run time depending on the way the user wishes to sort their recipes. The three concrete strategies are the different ways that the user can choose to filter their recipes and are depicted by the classes CalorieFilter, IngredientCountFilter, and NoFilter which all implement the FilterStrategy interface. The context part of the Strategy Design Pattern is demonstrated through the use of the FilterContext class which contains a reference to the filter strategy being used currently. By using the Strategy Design Pattern in our code, we give our users the ability to select different ways to view their recipes and ensure that our code is easily maintainable and extendable if we would like to add more ways to sort the recipes in the future.

            By adopting the MVVM architecture pattern and implementing various design patterns within Android Studio using Java, GreenPlate achieves a well-structured, maintainable, and scalable codebase. The separation of concerns between the Model, View, and ViewModel enables developers to work efficiently and collaboratively, while also ensuring a smooth user experience for GreenPlate's users. With a focus on clean architecture and best practices, GreenPlate is poised to deliver a sustainable food management solution that makes a positive impact on both users and the environment.
